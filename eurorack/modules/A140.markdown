## Usage

The envelope is started (triggered) by a gate signal either from the INT.GATE
voltage on the system bus, or, if a signal is put into it, from the gate input
socket.

The envelope can also be re-triggered, ie. start from scratch again, each time
a trigger signal is sensed at the Retrig. input socket, when the gate is still
high.
