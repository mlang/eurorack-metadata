## Accessibility notes

Switching between the various modes is a bit cumbersome.
LED color is used to indicate the current mode.  It can take a few
attempts until the desired mode is actually successfuly activated.
Luckily, upon power on, quantized pitch mode should be the default.
The last selected mode is not persisted across power cycles.
