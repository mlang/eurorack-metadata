## Usage

The frequency or pitch of the VCO is determined by the position of the octave
(Range) switch and tuning (Tune) knob, and by the voltage present at the CV
inputs. Footage (the octave of the fundamental) is set by the Range control in
five steps, and Fine tuning controlled by the Tune knob. The tune knob range
is about +/- 1/2 octave.

Pulse width of the square wave can be controlled via a knob (PW) and via the
voltage present at the PW-CV1 (without attenuatior) and PW-CV2 (with
attenuator) input.

## Details

The core is a sawtooth oscillator. The other waveforms are derived from the
sawtooth by internal waveform converters. As the sawtooth reset (i.e. the
back-to-zero slope) is not infinite fast but takes a little bit of time the
derived waveforms triangle and sine are not perfect! At the top of the
waveform they have a small glitch or notch that is caused by the sawtooth
reset and cannot be eliminated by the waveform converters. The sine is derived
from the triangle by a simple diode-based converter and the sine shape is not
perfect (only a rounded triangle).
