title: Eurocard standard units for the units-defs haskell package
tags: Haskell, Eurocard, units-defs

I just submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/goldfirere/units-defs/pull/16)
for the [units-defs](https://github.com/goldfirere/units-defs) Haskell package to
include `HorizontalPitch` and `RackUnit` as defined in the
[eurocard](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurocard_(printed_circuit_board)) standard
in the `Data.Units.Eurocard` module.

<!--more-->

These two types originate from the source code for this website.
Lets see if the maintainer of `units-defs` considers them useful.
